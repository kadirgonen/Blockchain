# Blockchain

We built a blockchain recently on my this work.
Since then, I've added 2 projects on my github account - one containing proof of work blockchain and the other containing proof of stake blockchain.

So, now we know how to build a blockchain and how the two most popular consensus mechanisms work. But blockchains themselves need to be propagated across peers.

This means - communication across multiple peers. In this example, I wanted to show that.
You need to open up multiple terminals to see this happen.
